Development builds of the latest commit are available from Appveyor. For release builds, see the **Releases** tab on GitHub.

**Warning:** These are development builds and may be ***unstable***.

Additionally, these builds are currently not optimized via PGO and will typically run a bit slower than the official release builds.
